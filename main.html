                        <p>
                        Howdy!  I'm Helen Cantao (née Ma) and am a programmer with 6 years of experience (1 professional), which includes personal projects.  
                        I graduated in December 2024 with a BS in Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science from Texas A&M. As of now, I'm looking 
                        towards having a career in software and digital application development.  
                        <br />
                        I found my passion for programming through developing web pages during my senior year of high school 
                        and thus decided to pursue it as a career.  My interests lie in software development and data science, and 
                        my work is a relection of my progress in those fields.
                        <br />
                        In my free time, I like to crochet, sew, and indulge in my artistic hobbies.  My portfolio includes a cirriculum 
                        vitae and a compilation of my projects.

                        <p>
                        My Luggage Handler (MLH) is a luggage handling system comprising of RFID chips, an SMS messaging system, and a web app that displays the 
                        status of a traveller's bags.  It was made using backend and frontend programming languages and an Arduino, and the prototype simulates 
                        the system for only one luggage.  I made MLH with 3 of my friends for Major Hacking League's Late Night Hacks Hackathon, and we won the most 
                        creative use to Twilio for this project.
                        <br>

                        <p>
                        Tabs is a web app that functions as a bulletin board for airports where passengers can post their lost items for others to find around the 
                        terminal and allows them to update the status of their items.  This app was built using HTML and vanilla CSS and Javascript, and it was submitted 
                        to the AA Challenge during Tamuhack 2023.  I coded the UI of Tabs and created a mock database storing user data, using JSON, which is then used 
                        for confirming login and displaying users' feeds.
                        <br> 
                        The Github repository and Devpost for Tabs are linked below.

                        <h3>ARMv8 Processor</h3>
                        <p>
                        This project is a replica of the ARMv8 processor in Verilog for ECEN 350, a course on computer architecture.  It uses various logic and controls units that 
                        manage 64 bits of local data based on inputted assembly code.  Each logic unit is tested in each lab and assembled together in the end to create an ARMv8 
                        processor.
                        <br>
                        The code for this project is linked below.

                        <h3>3D Spatial Audio Converter</h3>
                        <p>
                        The 3D Spatial Audio Converter is a system the converts VR audio into real world 3D environment and adjusts audio volume based on the user's location.  For 
                        this project, I'm in charge of building the Speaker & Audio Conversion subsystem, which plays corrected VR audio and adjusts speaker volumes based on the 
                        user's location after each ~20 ms time period.
                        <br>
                        The code used for this project, along with those of my Capstone teammates is below:

                        <h3>Chapel Daycare Website</h3>
                        <p>
                        The website for the Chapel Daycare contains information about the center, tuition for different programs, and sign-up forms for parents interested in 
                        touring and/or enrolling their child(ren) in the programs.  This site was built using ReactJS and CSS starting in January 2025.
